# Foodie Donor
- It is an Android application which helps its users to share their leftover food items with the poor and needy.

- It is a 2-in-1 application which automatically detects if the user is a  **Donor**  or a  **Receiver** and automatically displays the appropriate user interface (as displayed in screenshots below).

- Donors can give ratings to Receivers based on their transactional experiences.

### Some common terms

1.  A  **Donor** can be defined as an individual who wishes to donate a certain amount of his leftover food items to the poor and needy but don't want to manually go find and inspect trustworthy organisations.

And

2. A  **Receiver** can be defined as any organisation (e.g. Restaurants or NGOs) who directly interact with these needy people and provide them with food and essential commodities.

## Why of FoodieDonor?

1. It allows Donors to donate  **ANY AMOUNT**  of food items for the poor and needy from the comfort of their home‚ú®

2. Donors don't have to trust Receivers with their money anymoreüí∏

3. If the Receivers have a threshold of accepting at least a certain amount of items, then FoodieDonor acts as a buffer/intermediary between the multiple Donors and that particular Receiver until the threshold is reached.

## Features

- ‚òÅÔ∏è  **Cloud based**  - Therefore no chances of data-tampering.

- ‚ö°  **Fast**  - because it uses Google's Firebase Cloud Services for backend and all the modern Android development practices to optimise the code.

- üîê  **Secure** - because no data is stored on the application side and all transactions are handled by the server.

- üÉè  **2-in-1 app** - defines the user in one of the two categories (DONOR or RECEIVER) at the time of user-signup.
